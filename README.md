# Seattle Transit Dot Matrix Typefaces

A set of dot matrix fonts in the style of Sound Transit's displays. Inspired by [London TFL Dot Matrix Typeface](https://github.com/petykowski/London-Underground-Dot-Matrix-Typeface).

Faithful to the original, but with some additional characters and stylistic alternates. Incomplete. Please contribute!
